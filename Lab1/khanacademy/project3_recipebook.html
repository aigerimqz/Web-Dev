        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Make the dough <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Add flour, yeast, sugar, and oil to a medium mixing bowl and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Gradually add water while stirring with a fork until a soft, smooth dough forms. Press with your hands if needed. Alternatively, use a stand mixer with a dough hook on slow speed.</li>
            <li>Knead for 5 – 10 minutes until dough is smooth without any lumps</li>
            <li>Place dough in mixing bowl and cover with a damp towel. Let rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until doubled in size.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Make the filling<br>
        <ol>
            <li>While the dough is rising, make your filling. Use clean hands to squeeze out any excess water from your napa cabbage. Combine the pork, cabbage, ginger, rice cooking wine, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, salt, and sugar in a mixing bowl. Stir until well-combined.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Fill and wrap your bao<br>
        <ol>
            <li>After your dough has doubled in size, gently punch down with your fist to release the air. Place on a floured surface and knead until the dough is back to its original size. Roll into a long cylinder and cut into 24 round, even pieces.</li>
            <li>Gently flatten each piece into a circle. Use your dominant hand to push with the rolling pin, and rotate the dough with your other hand, flattening only the edges. Keep the center thick to prevent leaks. Your wrapper should be about 5 inches in diameter. Refer to the video above for visual guidance.</li>
            <li>Place a few spoonfuls of filling in the center of the wrapper. Hold the wrapper with your non-dominant hand and pinch the edges together with your thumb and index finger of your dominant hand. Refer to the video above for visual guidance.</li>
            <li>Let the buns sit for 20 – 30 minutes until puffy.</li>
            <li>Boil water in a steamer. After water is boiling, line the steamer with parchment paper and place bao in. Steam for 18 minutes. Remove and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
