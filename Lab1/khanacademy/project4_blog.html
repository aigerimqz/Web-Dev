        <h6>Posted on 23 November, 2024</h6>
        <p class = "body_blog">I’m thrilled to share that I’ve started my first internship! It's a huge milestone in my journey to becoming a software engineer. The first few days have been a mix of excitement and nervousness, but I’ve already learned so much.

I’m working with a talented team of developers, and they’ve been really supportive as I get up to speed. So far, I've been involved in several projects, including learning how to collaborate using version control and getting a deeper understanding of the tools and languages we’re using. It’s been a great hands-on learning experience that I can already tell is going to make a big difference in my skills.

Even though the learning curve is steep, I’m enjoying every challenge that comes my way. It’s exciting to finally apply what I’ve been learning in school to real-world tasks and problems.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue this journey!!</p>

        <h2 id = "second-post">Diving into Java</h2>
        <h6>Posted on 21 January, 2025</h6>
        <p class = "body_blog">This week, I started learning Java, and it’s been both exciting and challenging. I’ve heard so much about Java being one of the most versatile languages, widely used for web development, Android apps, and large-scale enterprise systems, so I knew I had to get familiar with it.

At first, I struggled a bit with the syntax differences compared to languages I’m used to, but the more I practice, the more I’m starting to appreciate its structure. Java’s object-oriented approach is something I’m really starting to understand and enjoy. I’ve already written a few simple programs, and I’m amazed at how clear and organized the code can be.

The best part is seeing how everything connects: classes, methods, and objects. I’m currently focusing on understanding loops, conditionals, and object-oriented concepts in depth. It feels like a big step forward in becoming a well-rounded programmer, and I can’t wait to learn more about Java’s rich ecosystem of frameworks and tools.

Looking forward to creating my first real Java project soon!</p>
